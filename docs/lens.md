# Lens

## What is [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) ?

Lens is a central tool used to visualize data for all your Kubernetes clusters.

## Setting up Lens

1. Install Lens from [here](https://k8slens.dev/).

2. Open the application.

3. Open your kubeconfig:
    - Navigate to `home` directory → `KUBERNETES CLUSTERS` → `Local Kubeconfigs` → `+ Add Kubeconfig`

Right-click on the cluster name to access shortcuts to `Settings` and more.

Lens requires a Prometheus scraping tool to display and visualize data as graphs.

Enable metrics in `Settings` → `Lens Metrics`
